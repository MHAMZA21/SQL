## HAVING CLAUSE IN SQL
## SYNTAX
## select column name
## from table
## where condition
## group by column name
## having condition
## order by column_name

## the having clause in SQL operated on grouped records and return records where 
## rows where aggregate function results matched with given condition only

## Where and having condition are similiar but where condition not performed on aggregate functions
##find cities where more than 2 employees

select City,count(Emp_id) as employees_id from employees

## find dept who has more than 2 employees

## suppose I want cities that have more than two employees apart from lahore
select count(*), City as cities

##Subqueries in sql
## subqueries is query with another query which is embedded with where clause, from clause and having clause 

show databases;
use sql_intro;

select * from employees;
select * from c_products;
select * from emp_details;
select * from orders;
select * from products;
select * from sales;

## Suppose you want to find employess whose salary is greater than average salary in this scenario you can use subqueries
select emp_name, dept, salary 
from employees where salary > (select avg(salary)from employees);

## display all employees whose salary > than salma

select emp_name,dept,gender,salary 
from employees where salary > 
(select salary from employees where emp_name = 'salma');

## use subquery to fetch data from two different table
## Table 2 
use classicmodels;
select * from employee;
select * from employees_b;
select * from customers;
select * from products;
